# Task 3: Machine Learning Model Implementation

This notebook is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I worked on applying machine learning techniques to a dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
- Performed exploratory data visualization using matplotlib.
- Implemented machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained the model(s) and evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics.

## What I Learned
- How to prepare raw data for machine learning.
- The workflow of training and testing a model.
- How to visualize data and interpret model performance results.
- The importance of preprocessing in improving model accuracy.

This task helped me gain hands-on experience with building and evaluating machine learning models from scratch.  
Feel free to check out the notebook and suggest improvements!
